    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate Junior .NET Developer who loves building backend systems using C# and SQL.
      Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Angular to become a Full-Stack Developer. I'm always excited to learn
      new technologies, work on real-world projects, and grow as a developer.
